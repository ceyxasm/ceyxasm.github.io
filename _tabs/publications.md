## Overview
This page showcases my research work spanning computer vision, natural language processing, and interdisciplinary studies. My work ranges from technical contributions in AI/ML to philosophical explorations of technology and society.
Currently working on LLMs. More updates coming soon... :)

## Peer-Reviewed Publications

### ChapVidMR: Chapter-based Video Moment Retrieval using Natural Language Queries
**ICVGIP 2024** • *Dec 2024*
- This work addresses Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) by leveraging YouTube chapters for meaningful video segmentation. We propose a novel approach that links natural language queries to multiple relevant moments within videos, rather than single moments as in traditional VMR tasks. Our method utilizes chapter-based segmentation to improve temporal localization accuracy in long-form video content.

### WVSC-I: NCVPRIPG 2023 Summer Challenge on Writer Verification
**NCVPRIPG 2023** • *Aug 2023*  
- This report presents the outcomes of the Summer Challenge on Writer Verification, a competition focused on determining whether pairs of handwritten Hindi text images were written by the same or different writers. The challenge addressed the complex problem of offline handwriting verification without dynamic writing information, requiring models to learn individual handwriting style variations for fraud detection applications.

## Technical Reports

### FISB: Feature-based Image Stitching Benchmark
**Computer Vision** • *April 2023*  
- A comprehensive benchmark for evaluating feature-based image stitching algorithms, providing standardized datasets and evaluation metrics. This work establishes a framework for comparing different feature extraction and matching techniques in panoramic image creation, addressing the need for consistent evaluation in the image stitching domain.

### Why CNNs Work? Understanding Their Mechanism Through Histopathologic Cancer Detection
**Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning** • *April 2022*  
- An in-depth analysis of Convolutional Neural Networks' effectiveness using histopathologic cancer detection as a case study. This work explores the theoretical foundations of CNN architectures, investigating how feature hierarchies and spatial invariance contribute to their success in medical image analysis tasks.

## Philosophical & Cultural Studies

### Understanding the JEE Aspirant/College Student Experience
**Philosophical Anthropology** • *April 2024*  
- An ethnographic exploration of power dynamics, everyday realities, and social constructs within India's competitive education system. This work examines the psychological and social impact of high-stakes testing culture on student identity formation and institutional relationships through an anthropological lens.

### Nothing is True; Nothing is Permitted: A Cultural Analysis of Assassin's Creed
**An Introduction to Cultural Studies** • *April 2024*  
- A critical cultural analysis of Assassin's Creed: India Chronicles and Assassin's Creed Brahman, examining how video games construct and represent Indian cultural narratives. This work investigates the intersection of digital media, historical representation, and cultural identity through the lens of postcolonial theory and media studies.

### Semantics and Pragmatics: Differences Through Cognitive Semantics
**Cognitive Semantics** • *April 2024*  
- A theoretical examination of the distinctions between semantics and pragmatics from a cognitive linguistic perspective. This work explores how meaning construction operates at different levels of language processing, investigating the role of conceptual structures and contextual interpretation in human communication.

### Birth of Tragedy: An Attempt at Appreciation and Criticism
**Philosophical Anthropology** • *February 2024*  
- A critical engagement with Nietzsche's "The Birth of Tragedy," offering both appreciative analysis and contemporary critique. This work examines the philosophical tensions between Apollonian and Dionysian principles, relating ancient Greek aesthetics to modern questions of art, culture, and human experience.
