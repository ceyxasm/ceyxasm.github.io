Hello there! 👋 I'm **Abu Shahid**, a Computer Science and Engineering graduate with a sharp interest in Artificial Intelligence, Physics, and Arts.

As a kid, I wanted to do everything *except* engineering. Through some not-so-terrible developments, here I am! This is my story - what began in front of a PC in Lucknow is now cruising everywhere on the web.

## 🚀 What I'm Building

Currently I am busy in migrating and setting up this blog space. Will be notifying about the upcoming works :))

## 💼 What I Do

* **Machine Learning Engineer @ AttentionTag** *Aug 2024 - Present*

I deploy machine learning models from research to production, specializing in attention monitoring and behavioral forecasting systems. My work spans cross-platform model deployment for browser-based inference, building computer vision pipelines that analyze human attention patterns, and developing analytics. Beyond ML, I handle backend development, write integration code, and maintain SDK implementations to bridge models with real-world applications.

* **Previous Adventures in ML & Research**

During my fellowship at **Microsoft Bing**, I worked on multi-modal video retrieval using natural language queries, which led to a paper at ICVGIP'24. At **Decimal Point Analytics**, I built some really good OCR models for financial documents and delivered a novel dataset with 2 million plus datapoints and improved over all inference time and performance. 
I've also worked as a **freelancer** on natural document understanding projects and as an **AI consultant** for a startup building EHR systems for hospitals.

* **Academic & Community Work**

I organized the Writer Verification challenge at NCVPRIPG'23, secured 2nd place among 500+ teams in a government hackathon for surveillance anonymization, worked on OCR for Indic languages and spent three semesters as a TA helping students debug their understanding of machine learning along with their numpy arrays.

Full resume at the bottom, or just say hi!

## 🎨 When I'm Not Coding

**I <3 reading and learning**

I read voraciously across genres - from classical literature to contemporary sociology. You'll find my thoughts scattered across blog posts about books and articles exploring sociological themes. I also write foundational ML paper breakdowns.

When I'm not buried in books, I'm exploring various interests - some more developed than others. Currently cultivating habits around fitness, and outdoor adventures.

## 🤝 Let's Connect

I'm always up for interesting conversations about technology, art, physics, or why UTF-8 is the only character encoding that matters.

**Want my resume?** [Download it here](/assets/pdfs/mpcv_06_25.pdf) - it's more formal than this page, I promise.
